# 3DP-Actuator

This repository holds 3D files and bills of material to build 3D printed, quasi-direct drive actuators. Publications with full characterizations of these actuators are under review.

The preprint can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12395

More content will be added to this repository, including assembly guides, 3D printing recommendations, and component variations, after publication.

Files marked `*_hitemp.stl` should be printed in hi-temperature resin (e.g., Formlabs Hi-Temp V2).
